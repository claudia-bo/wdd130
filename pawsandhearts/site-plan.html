        We are a formal nonprofit organization dedicated to finding homes for puppies and kittens in need. We organize the largest pet adoption fair in the city; we work with different animal shelters and together we organize this event so that more people can make the beautiful decision to welcome a dog or cat in need into their home. On this page, you will find the date and location of the event. We will also have a variety of activities during the fair for those who visit us. The activities that will take place during the event are designed for people to get to know the pets better and spend time with them. You will also be able to talk to people who work in the different shelters so you can learn a little about their facilities, the history of the institution, and the various ways we can all help, even if we cannot take a pet into our home. After this event ends, the website will be updated and will continue to operate so that the adoption can still be carried out through this means. We must think that it is not so important the fact that we will help a puppy or a kitten have a home, but to think that now we receive it in our home we will receive an unconditional and entirely selfless love that we often do not deserve. Animals are not toys that are only attractive when they are babies; they are living beings that deserve to live a quality life, and it is in our hands to make that possible.

      <h3>Our Pets</h3>
      <p>
        We have many puppies that are up for adoption; you can meet each one of them either in person when you visit the fair or in photos on our website. We will also provide you with information about each one regarding their background, medical history, special needs, and the care they require. We know that each of the pets available for adoption is different; some are just a few months old while others are already elderly. Some have a difficult past because they have suffered from abuse, abandonment, etc., and that is why they may develop behavioral problems such as fear, aggression, territoriality, and many others, it is necessary to understand how to deal with each type of situation. There are also dogs that are very playful, destructive, or very lively; it is important to know these qualities before making the decision to adopt. Additionally, there are pets with medical issues, some of which require lifelong care. and others who only need some short-term medical assistance. All this information will be provided to each of the applicants for adoption so that, with the guidance of professionals, they can choose the perfect companion for their homes and evaluate all the options they have.

      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        There are some requirements for adoption, and we will share these requirements with everyone interested, there are forms that must be filled out, and also guarantees required for safe adoption. Not everyone is ready to have a pet in their home, which is why each applicant will go through a selection process to ensure the well-being of the dogs and to prevent them from being abandoned on the streets again or returned to the shelter from which they came. If you can't attend the event that day, you can apply to adopt one of our little pets through our website; you just must fill out the form and schedule an interview with the responsible people to begin the adoption process.
