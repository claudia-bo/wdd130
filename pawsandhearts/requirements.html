                <p>There are some requirements for adoption, and we will share these requirements with everyone interested, there are forms that must be filled out, and also guarantees required for safe adoption. Not everyone is ready to have a pet in their home, which is why each applicant will go through a selection process to ensure the well-being of the dogs and to prevent them from being abandoned on the streets again or returned to the shelter from which they came. If you can't attend the event that day, you can apply to adopt one of our little pets through our website; you just must fill out the form and schedule an interview with the responsible people to begin the adoption process.
